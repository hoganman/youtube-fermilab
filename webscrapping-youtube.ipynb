I‚Äôve been following your channel for years now and have followed several other similar channels and this channel is the best. The way you explain physics makes it easier for most people to understand how ‚Äúthings‚Äù work. I‚Äôve always say that you can be an expert and one of the best scientist in a specific area but one thing is to ‚Äúknow‚Äù things and how to applied them and another is to teach them. You now how to teach, not everybody knows how to do that. If you know how to teach you can learn and explain anything even though is not the field of your expertise. Keep it going! ',\n 'We had Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Faraday, Tesla and all the great masters of science and many of those masters came together at the Solvay conference.\\r\\nNowadays we have other masters who seek to find the answers made by the great masters of the past and you Mr. Don Lincon is one of those masters. Thank you very much for explaining the Quantum world to us.',\n 'Hi Dr Don Lincoln. Just like to say a big thanks for all the videos you do.

I'm a PhD student in physics and although my field is optics, particle physics has always kept my interesting. So, I would like to give you a suggestion that I very much like to see in this channel: would it be possible for you to make a video more formal about HOW quarks, gluons, W and Z bosons, etc, were detected and more importantly, describe how the data implies the existence of those particles. Man, you would just made my life whole by making this kind os videos. Thank you so much and be safe out there!!! Bye!!\",\n \"This series is a brilliant idea. I always wanted to really understand the famous property that all particles have: ‚Äúthe spin‚Äù. As far as I'm concerned even great scientists have difficulties to get their heads around it.

I do have a question:\\nWhat is the connection of the concept of time as described by the \"arrow of time\" linked to increasing entropy in the universe and the (seemingly alternative and disconnect) concept of time that physicists refer to when talking about space-time? How does \"warping space-time\" affect the \"arrow of time\"?\\n\\nI hope you see this and give some of your thoughts! I hope the question is not too vague.

I watch all of your videos and other channels, I am interested in learning in a reasonable depth the standard model and the nature of these \"Lego pieces\" and how the macro connects to the micro.

I not looking for fast and superficial, but a class where we build the staircase one step at a time.',\n 'Thanks for continuing to stimulate us during these testing times! Q: Is the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics derivable from the Standard Model or Relativity? I think you suggested that all phenomena could, in principle, be related to these two theories.

Thank you for making these!\",\n \"Dr Lincoln, I enjoy your videos a lot.  You obviously put a lot of time in them, and you make this information accessible to interested people like me.  I have several questions about black holes; I hope these are not too much off topic for this video.  I'll put the first question here and then ask the second one in a new comment.  First question: Let's say we have three things: A super massive black hole, an observer at a safe distance, and an object falling in.  I've heard on many videos that the object falling in (assuming it survives spaghettification, which is why I chose a supermassive one) would experience time in the normal way, while the observer would never actually see the object cross the event horizon.  From the observer's perspective the object would simply move closer and closer to the black hole, always slowing down (time dilation).  However, from the LIGO observatory we've recorded many black hole mergers.  If black hole 2 (the object falling in) never crosses the event horizon of black hole #1, then per the observer (LIGO),  how do we detect the merger?\",\n 'Thank you so much for doing these videos .. I learned a lot from you ! Love discovering science',\n \"I have a request while you're making these videos. If possible, when discussing electromagnetism and the photon, one of the things that I have a hard time wrapping my head around is how the transfer of photons produce an attractive force. Usually light hitting things just heats things up or imparts some momentum.\\n\\nMy second head scratcher is how the strong nuclear force gets stronger as the distance between quarks increases. This strikes me as the opposite of how the other forces behave. Why is the strong nuclear force different? I've only heard this described once and I'm not sure the description was correct.\\n\\nAs a ancillary thought that might not fit with these videos, why do we not have (any?) technology based on the weak nuclear force? We've built tech around the other 3 forces, why not this one? Is there any conceivable way to use this force.\",\n 'Thanks! Looking forward to this! Force-carrying particles are very confusing to me. For example, 2 similar or oppositely charged particles have a force carrying particle (photon) between them. HOW does this create an attractive or repulsive force between them, and WHY would this force vary inversely with the square of the distance? I hope you can cover that in a future video. Thanks again for doing this.',\n \"Thumb up, Prof ! You stay safe at home, don't catch the covid-19 !

What a promise!\\n\\nI am most excited and eagerly await your revelations, along with gazillion others.',\n 'hands down best source for learning physics, thank you Dr. Lincoln',\n 'Cannot wait for the next episode.

Quark was always my favorite Ferengi until he lepton the bar and got strange.',\n 'Glad to see another video from Dr. Lincoln! Question: what are your opinions about quark stars and degenerate matter? Do you think they exist? Stay safe!',\n 'Always enjoy your teaching Don!',\n 'Could you please talk about gluons and how they interact with quarks to generate such a strong force?',\n 'Question: When two electrically charged particles exchange a photon, a force acts on them.  If the particles have like charge, the force is repulsive.  If the particles have opposite charge, the force is attractive.  How do photon receiving particles ‚Äúknow‚Äù the charge of photon emitting particles.  I presume that is transmitted in some property of each photon, but I have never read or heard what that property is.  A similar, probably somehow the same, thing has to happen when photons transmit forces between magnets.  The receiving magnet has to somehow learn the orientation of the emitting magnet.  What property of photons carries this information and how does that interact with the magnets?',\n 'Thank you for this wonderful series!',\n 'Excellent initiative Dr Don! Stay safe! Remember: hand-washing and distancing are everything! Ô∏è',\n 'Dr. Lincoln . I must say I am a big fan of your videos.
